Practice Problems:

1. What are the required components of an HTTP request?
What are the additional optional components?

Solution:
Required: Method and Path.
Optional: Parameters, Headers, Body.

Given solution:
The HTTP method and the path are required, and form part of what is known as
the start-line or request-line. As of HTTP 1.0, the HTTP version also forms
part of the request-line. The Host header is a required component since
HTTP 1.1.Parameters, all other headers, and message body are optional.

Technically speaking the 'path' portion of the request-line is known as
the 'request-URI', and incorporates the actual path to the resource and
the optional parameters if present. In practice, most people simply refer to
this part of the request-line as the 'path'.

2. What are the required components of an HTTP response? What are the additional
optional components?

Solution:
Required: Status.
Optional: Headers and Body.

3. What determines whether a request should use GET or POST as its HTTP method?

Solution:
`GET` is used for requesting or fetching data that sits on the server.
`POST` is used for sending data to the server.

Given solution:
GET requests should only retrieve content from the server. They can generally be
thought of as "read only" operations, however, there are some subtle exceptions
to this rule. For example, consider a webpage that tracks how many times it is 
viewed. `GET` is still appropriate since the main content of the page doesn't change.

POST requests involve changing values that are stored on the server. Most HTML
forms that submit their values to the server will use POST. Search forms are a
noticeable exception to this rule: they often use GET since they are not 
changing any data on the server, only viewing it.
